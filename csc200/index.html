    <h1><small><font color="#ffffff">About Aviation Interaction:</font></small></h1>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aviation Interaction,
        founded by John Choi initially as a part of NC State University
        in 2016, is one of the leading modern aviation software company.
        It puts a substantial amount of effort to improve the current
        air traffic system. Its products continue to make the airspace
        safer and worry-free. Recently, it was recognized as a leading
        aerospace engineering company with its new product, ATC A.I. The
        company is expected to bring the air traffic death rates down to
        1% by 2020. </font></p>

    <h1><small><font color="#ffffff">Goals and Missions:</font></small></h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#ffffff">Our goal here at
        Aviation Interaction is to implement artificial intelligences
        into the Air Traffic Control system. Doing this reduces the
        chances that humans can make, preventing a potential disaster on
        the airport's runway. In fact, the statistics show that about
        58% of the aircraft accidents are caused by a human error.
        Implementing an artificial intelligence into the ATC would
        greatly reduce this percentage. Thus, our goal is to engineer an
        artificial intelligence that is specifically designed to operate
        an air traffic control with its perfect algorithms and logic. <br>
